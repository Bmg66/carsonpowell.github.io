Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Carson Powell, and I'm excited to share a bit about my journey in the fascinating world of AI and technology. From my early days troubleshooting computers to my current work in finetuning large language models, it's been an incredible adventure full of learning and growth.

## Discovering a Passion for Technology

Ever since I was young, I've been drawn to technology. I loved taking things apart, figuring out how they worked, and putting them back together (sometimes successfully!). This curiosity led me to dive deeper into the world of computers and software.

## Education and Skills Development

I graduated from Classical Academy High School in 2024, where I gained a solid foundation in various tech-related skills:

- **Adobe Photoshop** and **Adobe Illustrator**: These tools allowed me to express my creativity and design eye-catching graphics.
- **Python Programming**: Learning Python opened up a whole new realm of possibilities, from simple scripts to complex AI models.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: I delved into the world of AI, particularly focusing on large language models (LLMs).

## Hands-On Experience

### Counselor at Emmanuel Faith Community Church
In 2022, I started volunteering as a counselor at Emmanuel Faith Community Church, where I support Jr. High students. This role helped me develop strong communication and leadership skills.

### Tech Help Specialist
In 2023, I took on the role of Tech Help Specialist, troubleshooting computer issues and providing technical support to students and staff. This position sharpened my problem-solving abilities and deepened my technical knowledge.

### AI Research Assistant
Also in 2023, I began working as an AI Research Assistant. I conducted research on large language models and assisted in various AI projects, furthering my understanding and expertise in this cutting-edge field.

### Consultant in AI and Tech
More recently, I started consulting in AI and tech, providing expert advice on AI strategies and solutions. This role involves helping organizations implement AI technologies and ensuring their successful integration.

## Creating Finetuned LLMs for Different Use Cases

One of the most exciting aspects of my journey has been developing and finetuning LLMs for various applications. Customizing these models to meet specific project requirements has been both challenging and rewarding. Testing and evaluating their performance has given me invaluable insights into the practical applications of AI.

## Looking Ahead

As I continue to explore the world of AI and technology, I'm eager to see where this journey will take me next. Whether it's developing new AI models, solving complex tech problems, or helping others navigate the digital landscape, I'm passionate about making a positive impact through technology.

Thank you for reading about my journey! Stay tuned for more posts where I'll share insights, tips, and experiences from the world of AI and tech.
